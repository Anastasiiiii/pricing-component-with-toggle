# 💰 Pricing Component with Toggle

This is a **pricing component** built with **React** and enhanced with **Swiper.js** to add slider functionality for better mobile interaction. The component is inspired by the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) "Pricing Component with Toggle" challenge. Users can switch between monthly and yearly billing, and the layout adapts beautifully across all devices.
